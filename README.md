ResumeBuilder
=============

Builds a resume from your LinkedIn profile using LinkedIn's API.  How it builds your resume is through JasperSoft's
Business Intelligence tools.  This is accomplished through two bundled tools.  The first one being the
LinkedInDownloader and the second being the Jasperize.  As the names imply, the first tool downloads your LinkedIn
profile data and the second builds your resume for you.  This two stage process allows you to fiddle and customize
your LinkedIn data before automatically generating your resume.

Features are

* Download your LinkedIn profile data
* Generate your resume using a JasperSoft template
* Optionally include a cover letter with your resume
* Supports several formats which are PDF, DOCX, PPTX, ODT, XHTML

Installing
=============

You can install the source through master which is typically fairly stable or through a tag.  
The benfits of pulling from a tag is that you have a version number you can associate with any problems you might 
encounter.  Also, you know when there's a new version as I will always push new versions out through the tags.

Clone the repository ([Install git if you haven't alredy](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git))
