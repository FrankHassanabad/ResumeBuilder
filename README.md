ResumeBuilder
=============

Builds a resume from your LinkedIn profile using LinkedIn's API.  How it builds your resume is through JasperSoft's
Business Intelligence tools.  This is accomplished through two bundled tools.  The first one being the
LinkedInDownloader and the second being the Jasperize.  As the names imply, the first tool downloads your LinkedIn
profile data and the second builds your resume for you.  This two stage process allows you to fiddle and customize
your LinkedIn data before automatically generating your resume.

Features are

* Download your LinkedIn profile data
* Generate your resume using a JasperSoft template
* Optionally include a cover letter with your resume
* Supports several formats which are PDF, DOCX, PPTX, ODT, XHTML
