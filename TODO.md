* Update the package structure to have another depth instead of just
  frankhassanabad.com.github, it should be resumebuilder.frankhassanabad.com.github
* JavaDoc packaging with maven
* Add ".sh" run time files.
* change the fact that this directory is hard coed:
      data/LinkedInResumes/linkedInProfileData.xml
  at some point make that into its own configuration with switch.
* Add fonts to the resume from font awesome?
* Add hinted colors of a grey with the dates on the resume?
* Do I want testing at this point or delete all unit testing?
